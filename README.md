# Monica Le - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hi, I’m Monica! I have an analytical background in Applied Data Science & Statistics (MSc) and a strong interest in using data to solve complex, real-world problems across finance, ESG, and scientific domains.

During my degree, I worked extensively with Python, R, and advanced statistical modelling, applying them to fraud detection, financial forecasting, emissions analysis, climate modelling, and public health datasets. My experience spans both technical modelling and insight generation - translating raw data into clear, actionable conclusions.

I enjoy exploring new analytical tools, refining modelling workflows, and taking on projects that balance statistical rigour with practical impact. Whether independently or in a team, I’m driven by curiosity, structure, and the satisfaction of uncovering insights that matter.

This portfolio brings together work in fraud analytics, risk modelling, macroeconomic forecasting, and ESG-aligned emissions analysis, alongside scientific and statistical projects from my MSc. Across all projects, I focus on building interpretable models, working with complex data, and communicating findings clearly for real-world decision-making.

## Portfolio Projects
Below is a curated selection of my work, with a brief overview of the technology stack and analytical methods used.

## Finance Projects

### Trade, Policy & Carbon Emissions (ESG - MSc Dissertation)

**Folder:** finance-projects/esg-trade-emissions-analysis/

**Goal:**
Investigate whether globalisation contributes to carbon leakage by widening the gap between territorial and consumption-based CO₂ emissions.

**Description:**
-	Panel dataset (2010–2022) for EU countries
-	Fixed-effects models with time + country controls
-	Interaction: trade openness × environmental policy stringency
-	Robustness checks and sensitivity analyses
-	Visualisations and policy interpretation

**Skills:** panel regression, causal frameworks, ESG analytics

**Tech:** R (tidyverse, plm, ggplot2)

**Results:** Evidence of significant emissions-gap behaviour linked to trade intensity and policy interactions.

---
### BankSim Fraud Detection (Python, Machine Learning)

**Folder**: finance-projects/banksim-fraud-detection/

**Goal:**
Build a fraud detection model to classify suspicious transactions in the BankSim synthetic dataset.

**Description:**
The project includes:
-	Data cleaning & exploratory analysis
-	Feature engineering (transaction velocity, merchant patterns, amount anomalies)
-	Supervised models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
-	Unsupervised baseline: Isolation Forest
-	Evaluation: ROC AUC, precision-recall, class imbalance handling

**Skills:** imbalanced classification, anomaly detection, EDA, model evaluation

**Tech:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

**Results:** Identified key behavioural risk indicators and built models with strong discrimination performance.

---

### Experian Fraud & Money Mule Analysis

**Folder:** finance-projects/experian-fraud-detection/

**Goal:**
Translate a real-world inspired fraud detection challenge into a reproducible Python analytics workflow.

**Description:**
Originally an Excel-based challenge, I:
-	Rebuilt logic in Python
-	Engineered risk indicators (suspicious payments, device behaviours, transaction bursts)
-	Ranked customers by fraud likelihood
-	Produced interpretable insights for non-technical stakeholders

**Skills:** feature engineering, Excel-to-Python conversion, risk scoring

**Tech:** Python, pandas, Excel

**Results:** Developed interpretable risk signals aligned with money-mule typologies.

## Scientific & Statistical Modelling 

### London NO2 Air Quality Modelling (GAMs)

**Folder:** scientific-projects/london-air-quality-no2/

Modelled nitrogen dioxide concentrations using GAMs to assess meteorological effects, seasonal patterns, and long-term changes.

**Tech:** R (mgcv), ggplot2

**Skills:** GAMs, temporal analysis, environmental modelling

---

### Spatio-Temporal TB Risk Modelling (Brazil)

**Folder:** scientific-projects/brazil-tb-spatiotemporal/

Used Gaussian processes and spatial smoothing to explore TB risk across Brazilian regions over time.

**Tech:** R (gstat, mgcv)

**Skills:** spatial modelling, GP, geostatistics

---

### North Atlantic Plankton Biodiversity Study

**Folder:** scientific-projects/plankton-biodiversity/

Exploratory ecological analysis assessing biodiversity, environmental variation, and organism distributions.

**Tech:** R, tidyverse

**Skills:** EDA, ecological stats, visualisation

---

### Brazil Development Data Analysis

**Folder:** scientific-projects/brazil-development/

Analysis of socioeconomic indicators, regional patterns, and development metrics.

**Tech:** Python/R

**Skills:** EDA, visualisation, descriptive statistics
